\hypertarget{index_sec1}{}\section{Description.}\label{index_sec1}
Library for creating 2D Games for the Windows C\+MD. For exclusive use with Windows. Not compatible for versions lower than Windows vista. This library only provides the C functions for drawing on the console, and the structures for its usage. For a Full HD device the maximum screen size is 237x124 using the terminal font and an 8x8 pixel per tile, or 479x168 using the same font but 4x6 pixels per tile.\hypertarget{index_sec2}{}\section{Installation.}\label{index_sec2}
Installing C\+DM is pretty straightforward, you can either download the compiled binaries and header file from my github on the releases section and use them inside Visual Studio 2017 or compile them yourself for your version of preference. Keep in mind that most defines included inside windows.\+h are not assured to be declared in vs-\/tools\textquotesingle{} versions prior to v141, you may have to define them yourself.\hypertarget{index_sec3}{}\section{Usage.}\label{index_sec3}
Usage of C\+DM is extremely simple, just create a \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_c_d_m_context}{C\+D\+M\+Context}} using C\+D\+M\+Create\+Context, after that you can either change the font size and resize your window, change the title of your window or create a surface and start drawing. Keep in mind, inside your main loop, C\+D\+M\+Poll\+Events should not have anything running before it, and for optimization purposes C\+D\+M\+Draw should only be called once at the end of your loop.
